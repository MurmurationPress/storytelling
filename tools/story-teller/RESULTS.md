# Slice verification — 2026-10-21

## Executed

Linux desktop; Node.js 24.19.0; VS Code 1.142.0 (commit `6d62b1d5dace93a33b3a6d3eca1317bd5e15bcb1`); markdown-it 15.0.3; esbuild 0.28.2.

- `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run check`: pass. The extension host is plain CommonJS JavaScript; the build bundles the independent parser/player/browser renderer, not the extension API.
- `npm test`: **13 focused tests pass**. Covers initial/BOM/CRLF/unclosed frontmatter, sample component order, fence-aware separators, empty beats, punctuation/speakers, malformed chat preservation, nested fences, unsafe Markdown and navigation/edit reconciliation.
- `npm audit`: **0 vulnerabilities** at verification time. The initial old markdown-it pin was replaced before delivery; the lockfile pins the verified dependency tree.
- `npm run test:host`: **pass in an actual isolated VS Code Extension Development Host**, not a mocked VS Code API or standalone browser page. Opens a temporary Markdown source and invokes the contributed command; inspects the real rendered webview with test-only Electron CDP.

The host run verifies prose → chat → mixed beat; all three controls and boundary states; unsaved edits; insertion before the current beat; edited dialogue; preview remaining bound to its source when another document is selected; command reuse; empty-source recovery; focus staying on Next during manual navigation. Host source-edit operations use `WorkspaceEdit`, while control activation uses DOM clicks in the actual webview. This is not an OS pointer or screen-reader test.

A source fixture includes raw script/iframe markup, remote Markdown image/link and HTML-like chat speaker/message text. No executable script/image/iframe/link/style element appears in the story content, a script sentinel remains unset, and no request to the fixture's remote hostname is observed. Tests write only temporary documents; no manuscript is adapted or rewritten.

## Limits

- Syntax and reconciliation are provisional. Wholesale rewrites and identical/removed/split beats do not have stable author-supplied identities; the documented best-effort rules apply.
- Message delivery is whole-beat/manual, with no timers, typing indicators, delivered/read ticks or authored timing. The fictional scene is a syntax fixture, not evidence of an accepted manuscript adaptation.
- Links are inert and images use alt text. Local image presentation and other component types are deferred.
- Hidden-webview state restoration is implemented with the documented webview state/ready APIs, but tab hide/recreation and full application restart were not included in the automated host run. Full saved-session restoration is outside this slice.
- No actual macOS, Windows, remote-workspace, VS Code Web, screen-reader or high-contrast verification. Styles use VS Code theme variables and native buttons; broader accessibility verification remains open.
- Existing EPUB experiments and Art feature work were not changed or retested by this separate extension slice. No new EPUB, release, publication, merge or deployment is produced.
